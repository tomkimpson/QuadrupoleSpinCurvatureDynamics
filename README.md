# Spin Curvature Dynamics of a Pulsar in Kerr Spacetime with an arbitrary mass quadrupole

This code calculates the orbital motion of an astrophysical body, such as a pulsar, on a background Kerr spacetime with an arbitrary mass quadrupole. It is based on the [SpinCurvatureDynamics Code](https://github.com/tomkimpson/Orbital-Dynamics) for a Kerr spacetime, and the quasi-Kerr metric of [Glampedakis & Babak](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0510057). Going beyond the point particle approximation, we instead model an extended spinning body via the Mathisson-Papertrou-Dixon equations.
